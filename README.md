# Caesar Cipher Program

## Description

This is a Python program that implements a Caesar Cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The program can encode (encrypt) or decode (decrypt) messages based on the user's input.

## Features

- Encode (encrypt) a message by shifting letters to the right.
- Decode (decrypt) a message by shifting letters to the left.
- Handles shifts larger than the length of the alphabet using modulo operation.
- Keeps numbers, symbols, and spaces unchanged in the output.
- Asks the user if they want to restart the program after each run.



## Usage

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts:
   - Type `encode` to encrypt a message or `decode` to decrypt a message.
   - Enter the message you want to encode or decode.
   - Enter the shift number (the number of positions each letter should be shifted).
   - The program will display the encoded or decoded result.
   - You will be asked if you want to continue using the program. Type `yes` to restart or `no` to exit.

## Example

---plaintext
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello world
Type the shift number:
5
Here's the encoded result: mjqqt btwqi
Want to continue? Type 'yes' or 'no':
yes
```
